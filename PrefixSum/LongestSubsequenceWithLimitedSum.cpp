You are given an integer array nums of length n, and an integer array queries of length m.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the maximum size of a subsequence 
that you can take from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to
queries[i].

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or 
no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,2,1], queries = [3,10,21]
Output: [2,3,4]
Explanation: We answer the queries as follows:
-->The subsequence [2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 3. It can be proven that
2 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[0] = 2.
-->The subsequence [4,5,1] has a sum less than or equal to 10. It can be proven that
3 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[1] = 3.
-->The subsequence [4,5,2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 21. It can be proven that
4 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[2] = 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,3,4,5], queries = [1]
Output: [0]
Explanation: The empty subsequence is the only subsequence that has a sum less than or
equal to 1, so answer[0] = 0.*/
